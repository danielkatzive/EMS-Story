  <p>
    “Call 911!” Most New Yorkers have probably heard this shout at least a few times in their adult lives, and most have probably had to dial those critical digits themselves. If you call 911 with a medical emergency, the police department operator will immediately make a connection to a fire department dispatcher. The dispatcher will assess how critical the emergency is, locate a nearby ambulance staffed with either basic life support emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or, for serious calls, more advanced paramedics, and send it to the scene. A fire engine company with EMTs may also be dispatched to provide basic life support before the ambulance arrives.</p>
 
    <p>For the city overall, the EMS response system appears to work well. In the year ending March 31, 2022, the last period for which data is available, the average time it took an ambulance to reach the scene of a life-threatening medical emergency was about seven minutes. When patients were transported to hospitals, on average they reached there in 12 minutes after leaving the scene. But there were areas of the city where response times and hospital runs took longer.</p>
    
    <p>Disparities are partly a function of the city’s complicated archipelagic geography, spanning 3 islands and a mainland peninsula, all linked by bridges and tunnels. But the uneven distribution of emergency rooms across the boroughs, a phenomenon which has increased with the closing of many small neighborhood hospitals in recent years, is likely an underappreciated factor affecting both response time and ambulance travel.</p>
    
    <p>The average time it takes an ambulance to reach the scene of a serious illness or injury is fairly consistent across most areas in the city. An analysis of response times by zip code finds a standard deviation of less than four minutes around the citywide seven minute average, and 75% of the zip codes in New York City had average response times below 9 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Only three zip codes in the city reported average response times over more than ten minutes (excluding one midtown zip code which covers just one building). One of those covers JFK Airport. That location poses obvious logistical obstacles for first responders, and the citywide EMS data may not take into account the capacity of Port Authority Police officers to provide medical assistance before FDNY or private hospital medics arrive.</p>
    
   <p>The other two of those slow response zip codes cover Breezy Point, the windswept tip of the Rockaway Peninsula guarding the approaches to New York Harbor. On average, it took 911 dispatched first responders 14 minutes to reach the scene of a serious injury or illness in those zip codes, which also include the neighborhoods of Rockaway Point and Roxbury.

    <p>The community there relies on local volunteer ambulance companies run by Rockaway Point Volunteer Fire Department (RPVFD) and Roxbury Volunteer Fire Department to pick up the slack. According to Captain Ed Valentine, who heads the RPVFD rescue squad, his EMT’s can reach the scene of a call in the Breezy Point community in less than six minutes. His department’s numbers are not included in the city-wide EMS data.</p>

    <p>A glance at the map above makes it easy to guess why 911-despatched response times might be so long in Breezy Point. The community lies at the end of a 10-mile long peninsula, accessible only by a few roads which connect to Nassau County, and by the Marine Parkway Bridge from Brooklyn. </p>
    
    <p>But an absence of nearby private hospitals may be another factor. In New York City, the FDNY operates only about 2/3rds of the ambulances responding to 911 calls at any given time. Private hospitals or hospital groups, such as Jamaica Hospital, Northwell Health, NYU Langone, Mount Sinai, or New York Presbyterian, supply the rest. New York City’s unusual hybrid system evolved historically during a period when the public corporation which manages city-owned hospitals ran the city’s EMS system, before the FDNY took over.</p>
    
    <p>While the ambulances provided by private hospitals can be sent anywhere in the city by 911 dispatchers, they tend to operate close to their home bases. To resupply after treating patients, the ambulance must return to its home hospital, an important factor reducing their range. Paul Werfel, who recently retired as head of the Paramedic Program at SUNY Stony Brook and who previously worked as a paramedic for Jamaica Hospital, explains “they would send us down to Rockaway, and nobody liked that because you'd get trapped down in Rockaway for hours”. </p>
    
    <p>And when hospitals close, that can diminish ambulance service in their immediate neighborhood as a result. Taking the Catholic hospitals as an example, Werfel says “there used to be paramedics at Cabrini in Manhattan. There used to be paramedics at Saint Clare’s,  Vinny's [Saint Vincent’s]. In Queens, they used to be at Mary Immaculate and at St. John's on Queens Boulevard. Those places are gone.”</p>
     
    <p>Only one hospital remains on the Rockaway Peninsula, St. John’s Episcopal Hospital, after Peninsula Hospital closed in 2012. St. John’s does not run an ambulance service and is frequently “on diversion” says Captain Valentine, meaning they are too busy to take new patients in their ER. Coney Island Hospital, in Brooklyn on the other side of the Marine Parkway Bridge (recently renamed for Ruth Bader Ginsburg), is public, run by the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. This leaves Mount Sinai Brooklyn, up in Midwood (formerly Beth Israel) as the closest private hospital with an ambulance service, seven miles away from Rockaway Point. According to an article in a magazine for first responders from 2013, the closure of Peninsula Hospital and the ambulance service that was based there meant longer response times for the Rockaways.</p>
    
   <p>A comparison of the city’s EMS response data with the locations of hospital emergency rooms (ERs) across the city finds that none of the 40 zip codes which housed ERs had average response times longer than 8 minutes. In fact, none of the zip codes with the 30 slowest response times had hospital ERs within their confines. On average, calls from zip codes with ERs had a 24 second faster response time than calls from the 190 zip codes with no ER.</p>

    <p> Getting an ambulance to the scene of a serious accident or illness is only part of the story, of course. While EMTs can stabilize a patient and paramedics can undertake some more advanced interventions, getting the patient to the hospital quickly is critical to achieving a favorable outcome. A 2018 article in the Journal of Emergency Medical Services reviewed recent studies on EMS performance metrics and concluded that response time has been over-emphasized in analyzing EMS service, noting instead that “the most important time interval is total time from initial symptoms to definitive care (i.e., hospital care with physician intervention).”</p>
    
    <p>About 70% of 911 calls for life threatening injuries or illnesses resulted in transportation to a hospital in the year ending March 2022. On average, travel time to the hospital was a bit less than 12 minutes across the city. But the variation on hospital travel time was greater than it was for initial response time. The standard deviation was 426 seconds, nearly double that of initial response time, and 25% of hospital trips took 15 minutes or longer. </p>
    
    <p>Distance from the nearest hospital has a clear direct link to hospital travel time, and volunteer ambulance services are not able to compensate for that geographic reality. Captain Valentine of Breezy Point says his ambulances can usually reach Coney Island Hospital in 12 minutes, “but if there is traffic on the Belt…” he adds, trailing off. His team transports all cardiac cases to Coney Island Hospital, but level one trauma hospitals capable of treating the most severe injuries take longer to reach, with Kings County Hospital a 9-mile drive and about a 20-minute trip. Ambulances dispatched by the 911 system averaged an unsettling 24 minutes in reaching the hospital after leaving the scene of a life threatening illness or injury in Breezy Point, and some trips took nearly an hour. </p>
    
    <p>The zip codes for Breezy Point were slowest in terms of hospital travel time, but there were 40 zip codes in New York City where hospital travel averaged more than 15 minutes. None of those zip codes were home to hospital ERs and none of the zip codes which had ERs had average travel times exceeding 12 minutes. In fact, hospital travel time averaged less than 10 minutes in zip codes with ERs, versus more than 12.5 minutes in zip codes without. </p>

      <div class="container text">
   <p> The bottom line is that geography matters when it comes to emergency medicine, even in the confines of a densely populated city like New York. While New York will always face challenges delivering services to a population that spans rivers and open waterways, the loss of neighborhood hospitals appears to have compounded the problem.
